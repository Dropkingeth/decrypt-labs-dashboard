## 🎯 Step-by-Step Launch Process

### Step 1: Get $VIRTUAL Tokens
**Minimum needed: 100 $VIRTUAL** (creation fee)
**Recommended: 1,000-5,000 $VIRTUAL** (for pre-buy protection against snipers)

**Where to buy:**
- Uniswap (Base): Swap ETH → VIRTUAL
- $VIRTUAL contract: `0x0b3e328455c4059EEb9e3f84b5543F74E24e7E1b` (Base)

**Pre-buy Protection Table:**
| % Supply | $VIRTUAL Needed |
|----------|-----------------|
| 15% | ~1,100 |
| 30% | ~2,600 |
| 40% | ~4,100 |
| 50% | ~6,000 |

---

### Step 2: Prepare Agent Assets

#### Required:
| Asset | Spec | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Agent Picture** | Square, high-res | ✅ Use Cipher Bot #01 or custom |
| **Agent Name** | Unique identifier | `Decrypt Labs` or `CIPHER` |
| **Ticker** | Max 10 chars, no $ | `CIPHER` |
| **1-min Pitch Video** | From verified X | ⏳ Record from @PriceCipherHQ |

#### Video Approach: AI-Generated "Jimmy Neutron" Character
Instead of showing real faces, use an AI avatar as the Decrypt Labs mascot/spokesperson.

**Recommended AI Video Tools:**

| Tool | Best For | Price | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|-------|
| **HeyGen** | Realistic avatars | $29/mo | Custom avatar from image, great lip-sync |
| **Synthesia** | Professional/business | $29/mo | 160+ languages, expressive avatars |
| **D-ID** | Quick talking heads | Free tier | Upload any image, animate it talking |
| **Krikey AI** | 3D cartoon characters | Free tier | Text-to-animation, stylized look |
| **InVideo AI** | Cartoon style | Free tier | Text prompt → full cartoon video |
| **Revid.ai** | Short-form content | Free | AI cartoon shorts generator |

**Best Option for Us:** 
- **D-ID or HeyGen** — Upload a custom "Jimmy Neutron" character image, make it talk
- **Krikey AI** — If we want full 3D animated character

#### Video Script Template:
```
"Yo, I'm Jimmy Neutron — the AI brain behind Decrypt Labs.

We run automated trading bots on MNQ futures, 24/7. 
And here's the twist — you can watch every single trade 
happen live on our dashboard.

No hiding. No fake screenshots. Just real P&L, updated in real-time.

100% of our profits go back into buying and burning $CIPHER tokens.
The more we make, the more we burn. Simple.

This isn't another promise coin. This is a revenue machine.

Decrypt Labs. Let's get it."

### Step 3: Write Your Pitch Deck

#### Elevator Pitch (280 chars max):
```
Transparent trading bots that trade MNQ futures 24/7. 
100% of profits → $CIPHER buybacks & burns. 
Watch every trade live. Real revenue. Real results. 🤖📊
```

#### "How It Works" Section:
```markdown
## What is Decrypt Labs?

Decrypt Labs runs automated trading bots on MNQ futures (Nasdaq micro contracts) 
using ICT (Inner Circle Trader) strategies. All trades are executed through 
Apex Trader Funding accounts.

## How It Works

1. **Bots Trade 24/7** — Our algorithms execute ICT-based strategies during 
   optimal market sessions (Silver Bullet, London Close, etc.)

2. **Transparent Dashboard** — Watch live P&L, positions, and trade history 
   at decryptlabs.io. No hiding, no fake numbers.

3. **Revenue → Buybacks** — 100% of net trading profits are used to buy back 
   and burn $CIPHER tokens, creating deflationary pressure.

4. **NFT Holders Win** — Cipher Bot NFT holders get revenue share, exclusive 
   access, and governance rights.

## Key Features
- Live trading dashboard
- 3 active trading bots (150K+ AUM)
- ICT-based algorithms (FVG, OTE, Silver Bullet)
- Fully transparent P&L
- Revenue-backed tokenomics
```

**Option A: Standard Launch** (Recommended for new projects)
- Launches immediately on bonding curve
- Graduates to Sentient at 42,425 $VIRTUAL market cap

**Option B: Unicorn Launch** (For established projects)
- Schedule launch date in advance (3+ days)
- More marketing time

- Good for: If you have existing audience

**Recommendation:** Start with **Standard Launch** — faster to market, iterate based on feedback.

- [ ] Share in Discord
- [ ] Pin contract address in all channels
- [ ] Update decryptlabs.io with token info

**First 24 hours:**
- [ ] Engage with early buyers
- [ ] Post dashboard screenshots showing live trading
- [ ] Thread explaining the revenue model

**First week:**

## 💰 Tokenomics Decisions

### Pre-Buy Strategy
| Option | % | Cost | Pros | Cons |
|--------|---|------|------|------|
| Minimal | 0% | 100 $VIRTUAL | Pure community launch | Vulnerable to snipers |
| Moderate | 15-30% | 1,100-2,600 | Balanced, some protection | Medium cost |
| Aggressive | 50%+ | 6,000+ | Strong control | High upfront cost |

**Recommendation:** 15-30% pre-buy for sniper protection without looking greedy.

### Vesting (Unicorn only)
- Default: 1-month cliff, 12-month linear vest
- Can customize up to 1 day before launch
