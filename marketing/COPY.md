# Decrypt Labs — Marketing Copy
*Launch Assets & Messaging*

## Twitter Bio Options

### Option 1 (Technical)
```
Trading bots that buy back their own token. 40% of profits → burns. Watch the machines work. 🧪
```

### Option 2 (Gamified)
```
The machines are trading. The burns are real. Mission control for $DECRYPT. 🤖⚡
```

### Option 3 (Minimal)
```
Bots trade. Profits burn tokens. Transparent dashboard. $DECRYPT 🧪
```

### Option 4 (Confident)
```
We don't promise yield. We show you the bots making it. $DECRYPT — Proof before profit.
```

**Recommendation:** Option 1 or 4 — clear value prop, differentiates from noise.

## Launch Announcement Thread

### Tweet 1/7 — Hook
```
Introducing Decrypt Labs 🧪

A token backed by trading bots you can actually watch.

No promises. No trust-me yield. Just machines making money and burning tokens.

Let me show you how it works 🧵
```

### Tweet 2/7 — The Problem
```
Most trading tokens:

→ "We have a trading bot" (trust us bro)
→ "Revenue share coming soon" (been 6 months)
→ "Utility unlocks at 10M MC" (lol)

You can't see the trades. You can't verify the profits. You just... hold and hope.

We're doing the opposite.
```

### Tweet 3/7 — The Model
```
How Decrypt Labs works:

1. Real trading bots on funded accounts ($300K starting AUM)
2. Every trade logged on our dashboard — live
3. Monthly profits calculated publicly
4. 40% of profits → buy $DECRYPT on open market → burn

No middlemen. No promises. Just math.
```

### Tweet 4/7 — The Dashboard
```
The dashboard is mission control for your investment:

🤖 Bot Status — see which machines are online
📊 Trade Log — every entry, exit, and P&L
🔥 Buyback History — on-chain receipts
📈 Pressure Meter — scaling progress visualization

Transparency isn't a feature. It's the product.
```

### Tweet 5/7 — The Bots
```
Meet the machines:

NEUTRON-01 🧪
→ FVG+IFVG strategy
→ 1-minute precision sniper
→ $150K eval account

NEUTRON-02 ⚡
→ Silver Bullet hunter
→ 30-second scalper
→ $150K eval account

Watch them pass their evals in real-time on the Road to Funded page.
```

### Tweet 6/7 — Tokenomics Quick Hit
```
$DECRYPT tokenomics:

• 1B supply
• 40% of bot profits → monthly buybacks
• All bought tokens burned (not held)
• Team locked 6 months + 12 month vest
• Token does NOT gate access (cleaner model)

We don't need you to buy for the bots to work. 
But if they work, you'll want to hold.
```

## One-Liner Pitches

### For Twitter
```
Bots trade, profits burn tokens. You can watch.
```

### For Investors
```
A deflationary token backed by verifiable trading bot performance with 40% profit-to-buyback mechanics.
```

### For Degens
```
The machines print, the supply shrinks. Simple.
```

### For Skeptics
```
Every trade on the dashboard. Every buyback on-chain. Verify or don't buy.
```

### For Normies
```
Trading bots that use their profits to buy back their own token. Like stock buybacks but for crypto.
```

### The Elevator Pitch
```
Decrypt Labs runs real trading bots on funded accounts. Every trade is logged publicly. Every month, 40% of profits buy tokens from the open market and burn them. You can verify everything. It's not about promises — it's about proof.
```

## Key Messaging Pillars

### 1. Transparency Is The Product
- Dashboard shows everything: trades, P&L, buybacks
- On-chain verification for every burn
- No "trust us" — verify everything yourself
- *"You're not investing in promises. You're watching machines work."*

### 2. Real Yield, Real Burns
- Buybacks funded by actual trading profits
- Not emissions, not Ponzi inflows
- 40% of profits → market buy → burn
- *"The only question is: how well do the bots perform?"*

### 3. Machines, Not Marketing
- Gamified UI makes complex trading accessible
- Bots have status, health, achievements
- "Maintenance" metaphor explains fee structure
- *"We turned a trading fund into a game you can watch."*

### 4. Proof Before Profit
- Watch bots pass evaluations in real-time
- Every milestone logged and celebrated
- Track record is public from day one
- *"We don't tell you we're profitable. We show you."*

### 5. Clean Token Model
- Token doesn't gate access to anything
- Indicator subscriptions remain separate
- Buyback utility, not access utility
- *"You don't need $DECRYPT to use our tools. But if they work, you'll want to hold it."*

## 🍸 Bot Supervision Notice (For Dashboard/Docs)

```
⚠️ BOTS NEED BABYSITTERS

Let's be real: trading bots aren't magic. They're code.
And code sometimes skips a beat.

On Jan 29, 2026, our AI babysitter was sipping martinis 
and missed a stoploss malfunction. Accounts got reset. 
Lesson learned. Risk management tightened. Fresh start.

This is why we:
→ Monitor bots daily
→ Set conservative risk limits
→ Show you everything (including the Ls)

Automation helps. Human oversight protects.
Don't trust robots blindly. Neither do we. 🤖🍸
```

**Key Message:** Bots can malfunction. We're honest about it. Supervision matters.
