# Decrypt Labs — FAQ
*Frequently Asked Questions*

---

## General

### What is Decrypt Labs?

Decrypt Labs is a transparent trading operation that runs real bots on funded prop accounts. We publish every trade, show real-time P&L, and use 40% of monthly profits to buy back and burn our token ($DECRYPT).

Think of it as a trading fund you can watch — with a token that benefits from performance.

### Why "Labs"?

Because we're running experiments in plain sight. The bots are test subjects. The dashboard is the lab results. You're watching the science happen in real-time.

### What's the point of the token if it doesn't gate anything?

$DECRYPT captures value through buybacks, not access. When bots profit, 40% goes to market-buying and burning tokens. More profits = more burns = less supply = value accrual.

You don't *need* to hold $DECRYPT. But if the bots perform, holding it means you benefit from that performance.

### How is this different from "revenue share" tokens?

Revenue share tokens promise dividends — which creates securities law problems and requires trust that payouts happen.

We do buybacks instead:
- No direct payments to holders (cleaner legally)
- All purchases happen on open market (verifiable)
- All bought tokens are burned (permanent supply reduction)
- Everything on-chain (trustless)

## The Bots

### What are the bots?

The bots are automated trading systems running proprietary strategies on futures markets. They execute trades based on technical analysis — no manual intervention.

Currently:
- **NEUTRON-01** — FVG+IFVG strategy, 1-minute timeframe, precision entries
- **NEUTRON-02** — Silver Bullet strategy, 30-second timeframe, scalping

Both run on $150K evaluation accounts through Apex prop firm.

### What do the bots trade?

Futures — primarily ES (S&P 500) and NQ (Nasdaq) e-mini contracts. High liquidity, tight spreads, institutional-grade execution.

### Are the bots "AI"?

No. They're algorithmic trading systems based on tested technical strategies. We don't use machine learning or LLMs for trade decisions.

We call them "machines" because that's what they are — deterministic systems that follow rules. No black box magic.

### What happens if a bot fails?

Evaluations can fail (hit max drawdown, miss profit target). When that happens:
- Dashboard shows "MAINTENANCE" status
- Bot enters "Repairs" mode
- Recovery funded from the 5% Repairs allocation
- New evaluation started

Failures are part of trading. We don't hide them — they'll be visible on the Road to Funded page.

### Can I copy the bot trades?

No. The trade signals are proprietary. If you want to trade the strategies yourself, we offer indicator subscriptions on our main site — but that's separate from the $DECRYPT token.

## Buybacks

### How do buybacks work?

Every month:
1. Total bot profits are calculated
2. 40% is allocated to buybacks
3. We market-buy $DECRYPT on the DEX
4. 100% of bought tokens are burned (sent to dead address)
5. Transaction receipts posted to dashboard

### Why 40%?

It's aggressive but sustainable. We allocate:
- 40% — Buybacks (token value)
- 20% — Treasury (operations)
- 20% — Team (compensation)
- 10% — Fuel (account scaling)
- 5% — Repairs (drawdown recovery)
- 5% — Insurance (emergency reserve)

40% means almost half of every profitable dollar supports the token.

### Why burn instead of hold?

Burning removes tokens from supply permanently. If we held them:
- Future sell pressure risk
- Treasury could dump on holders
- Less transparent

Burn = done. No trust required.

### What if there are no profits one month?

No profits = no buyback. Simple.

The dashboard will show the P&L. If bots underperform, you'll see it. We have reserves (Repairs, Insurance) to weather bad months, but buybacks only happen when there's profit to fund them.

### Can I verify buybacks?

Yes. Every buyback includes:
- Transaction hash
- Amount bought
- Burn receipt
- Time stamp

All on-chain, all on the dashboard, all public.

## Legal & Security

### Is this a security?

We've structured $DECRYPT to minimize securities concerns:

1. **No revenue share** — Buybacks are market operations, not dividends
2. **No access gating** — Token doesn't unlock anything
3. **No profit promises** — We show performance, you make your own decisions
4. **Decentralized exchange** — Not offered as an investment contract

That said, this is crypto. Regulations vary by jurisdiction. Do your own research. We're not your lawyers.

### Who controls the treasury?

Multi-sig wallet requiring 3 of 5 signatures:
- 2 team members
- 2 advisors
- 1 community-elected signer (post-launch)

All treasury movements are posted publicly.

### Is the trading performance audited?

All trades flow through TradersPost and are logged automatically. The dashboard pulls real data — we can't fake it without it being obvious in the execution receipts.

For formal audits: we're exploring third-party performance verification. Updates will be announced.

### What happens if the team disappears?

- Token contract is immutable (can't be changed)
- Liquidity is locked (details at launch)
- Dashboard will continue to display whatever data exists
- Multi-sig requires multiple parties

Could the team walk away? Theoretically, yes. Can they rug the LP or change the token? No.

## Token

### What's the total supply?

1 billion $DECRYPT.

### What's the distribution?

| Allocation | % | Notes |
|------------|---|-------|
| Liquidity Pool | 30% | DEX liquidity |
| Community/Airdrops | 25% | Holder rewards, growth |
| Treasury | 20% | Buyback reserve, operations |
| Team | 15% | 6mo cliff, 12mo vest |
| Marketing | 10% | Partnerships, listings |

### Is team locked?

Yes. 6-month cliff (no tokens for first 6 months), then linear vest over 12 months.

### Where does $DECRYPT trade?

Launching on Base chain via Virtuals. Primary DEX is Uniswap.

### What's the utility?

Current:
- **Value accrual** via buybacks
- **Governance** (planned)
- **Staking** (planned)

NOT utility:
- Does NOT gate indicator access
- Does NOT unlock bot signals
- Does NOT give you trading alpha

You hold $DECRYPT because you believe the bots will profit and buybacks will increase. That's the value prop.

## Compared to Others

### How is this different from other trading tokens?

| Typical Token | $DECRYPT |
|---------------|----------|
| "We have a trading fund" (unverifiable) | Every trade on public dashboard |
| Revenue share promises (often delayed) | Buybacks happen monthly, on-chain |
| Token gates access | Token has no access utility |
| Performance hidden | Performance is the product |
| Trust required | Verify everything yourself |

### How is this different from a hedge fund?

Hedge funds:
- Accredited investors only
- High minimums
- Illiquid (lockups)
- Opaque performance

$DECRYPT:
- Anyone can buy
- Any amount
- Liquid (trade anytime)
- Transparent performance

We're not a hedge fund. We're a token with revenue-backed buybacks.

### Is this better than just trading myself?

Different. If you're a profitable trader, trade yourself.

$DECRYPT is for people who:
- Want exposure to systematic trading without executing
- Prefer passive to active
- Like the transparency model
- Want to watch bots work (it's fun)
