## 🎯 SCALING CHANNELS (Ranked by ROI)

### 1. 🟢 TradingView (HIGHEST ROI)
**Why:** You already have 1,000 users on your indicator. That's not followers — that's USERS. They're actively using your tool.

**The Play:**
```
Current: 1,000 indicator users → passive
Goal: 1,000 indicator users → active community members
```

**Actions:**
1. **Add Call-to-Action in Indicator**
   - Update indicator description with links
   - Add tooltip text: "Join our Discord for live alerts"
   - Include decryptlabs.io dashboard link

2. **Publish Strategy Results**
   - TradingView has a "Publish Idea" feature
   - Post weekly: "OTE Silver Bullet Week Review"
   - Include actual trades from your dashboard
   - Gets you in front of ALL TradingView users

3. **Engage in Comments**
   - Reply to everyone who comments on your indicator
   - Offer to help with settings
   - Build relationships

4. **Launch More Indicators**
   - Port each bot's logic to a visual indicator
   - "FVG Detector" — marks Fair Value Gaps
   - "IFVG Scanner" — finds inverse FVGs
   - "Silver Bullet Window" — time-based highlighting
   - Each indicator = new audience funnel

**Estimated Impact:** 1,000 users → 5,000 users in 60 days

---

### 2. 🟡 X/Twitter (HIGH ROI, Requires Consistency)

**Why:** Algo trading / ICT Twitter is EXTREMELY active. One viral tweet = thousands of followers.

**The Play:**
```
Current: ~0 followers, 3 posts
Goal: 5,000 engaged followers in 90 days
```

**Content Pillars (Daily Rotation):**

| Day | Content Type | Example |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| Mon | Week Preview | "Here's what the bots are looking for this week..." |
| Tue | Educational | Thread on ICT concept (OTE, FVG, etc.) |
| Wed | Trade Highlight | Screenshot + analysis of best trade |
| Thu | Performance Update | "Thursday = best day for OTE bot, here's why..." |
| Fri | Week Recap | Stats + learnings |
| Sat | Behind the Scenes | Dashboard screenshots, dev updates |
| Sun | Community Engagement | Poll, question, or roast |

**Viral Hooks That Work:**

1. **Transparency Flex**
   - "While others show backtests, here's my bot's LIVE trades today..."
   - Include screenshot of dashboard with timestamps

2. **Call Out the BS**
   - "Signal sellers hate this one trick: showing actual results"
   - "Everyone's selling $500 courses. We just show you the trades."

3. **ICT Community Bait**
   - "FVG + IFVG confluence hit PERFECTLY at 10:47 AM"
   - Use their terminology, they'll engage

4. **Education + Proof**
   - Thread: "Here's how our OTE bot enters trades (with receipts)"
   - Show the exact setup → entry → exit

5. **Controversy (Carefully)**
   - "Backtested win rates are meaningless. Here's why."
   - "Your favorite signal seller didn't post this week's trades. Wonder why?"

**Growth Hacks:**
- Reply to EVERY ICT-related tweet with actual value
- Quote tweet big accounts with your take (not spam, actual insight)
- Engage with @ICT / @InnerCircleTradr content
- Join Twitter Spaces about trading (listen, then contribute)

**Estimated Impact:** 0 → 5,000 followers in 90 days (with consistency)

---

### 3. 🟡 YouTube (MEDIUM-HIGH ROI, Higher Effort)

**Why:** Long-form content builds DEEP trust. ICT YouTube is massive.

**The Play:**

   - "Why 76% Win Rate Matters More Than You Think"

5. **Behind the Scenes** (10 min)
