---

## Thread Structure

### Tweet 1 (Hook)
```
🧠 I built an AI that trades ICT concepts for me.

Not paper trading.
Not simulations.
Real funded accounts. Real money.

Here's how the indicator works ↓
```

### Tweet 2 (The Problem)
```
ICT methodology is powerful but overwhelming:
- Order blocks
- Fair value gaps
- Optimal trade entry
- Silver bullet timing
- Premium/discount zones

Most traders spend YEARS mastering this.

I automated it. 🤖
```

### Tweet 3 (The Solution)
```
ICT HTF Pro indicator detects:

✅ FVG zones (unmitigated gaps)
✅ OTE retracements (0.62-0.79 fib)
✅ Silver Bullet windows (10:00-11:00, 14:00-15:00)
✅ HTF bias alignment
✅ Liquidity pools

All automated. All in real-time.
```

### Tweet 4 (How It Works)
```
The magic is in the confluence:

1️⃣ HTF determines bias (4H/Daily)
2️⃣ Indicator waits for FVG to form
3️⃣ Checks if price is in OTE zone
4️⃣ Confirms Silver Bullet timing
5️⃣ Triggers entry signal

No emotions. No hesitation. Just execution.
```

### Tweet 5 (The Results)
```
Current live performance:

📊 2 bots running on funded accounts
💰 $302,000 AUM managed
📈 One account at 76% to payout
📈 Other at 63% to payout
🔄 Nearly 10,000 trades executed

All transparent. All verifiable.
