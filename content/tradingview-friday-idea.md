# TradingView Idea — MNQ Friday Outlook

**Title:** MNQ Friday Outlook | Consolidation & Liquidity Build

**Description:**
```
📊 MNQ Weekly Close Setup — Jan 30, 2026

Thursday's session swept the IPDA 20 Day High and delivered an 800+ point selloff into discount arrays. After a move like that, Friday typically consolidates.

✅ Documented this move on Twitter before it happened.

🎯 EXPECTATION: Equilibrium Consolidation

Price will likely hover around equilibrium, building:
• Sell Side Liquidity (SSL) below
• Buy Side Liquidity (BSL) above

This creates a trap — shorts get enticed by the "continuation" narrative.

📍 LEVELS TO WATCH:
• HTF Breaker + Order Block (formed before the run down)
• Equilibrium of the current range
• Discount arrays as support

⚠️ TWO SCENARIOS:

1️⃣ Consolidation → Push into HTF Breaker/OB
Shorts pile in, get squeezed into the breaker zone

2️⃣ Sideways Chop → Wait for Next Week
Low volume Friday grind, real move comes Monday

Either way — no need to force it. Let liquidity form, then strike.

📝 Will update Friday AM before market open if anything changes.
