## Agent Overview (Detailed — for Virtuals pitch deck section)

### What is Decrypt Labs?

Decrypt Labs is an autonomous AI trading system built on ICT (Inner Circle Trader) methodology. Our AI agent — Jimmy — runs a fleet of trading bots on funded Nasdaq futures accounts through Apex Trader Funding.

Unlike other "trading agents" that operate on paper or simulations, Decrypt Labs trades real capital on real markets. Every trade, every profit, every loss is tracked transparently on our live dashboard.

### How It Works

1. **Jimmy deploys bots** — 4 ICT strategies across up to 20 simultaneous bots on funded futures accounts
2. **Profits are generated** — Real trading on Nasdaq Micro E-mini futures (MNQ)
3. **80% of profits buy $CIPHER** — Automatic buyback from open market
4. **Tokens are burned** — Permanently removed from supply. Deflationary by design.

### Trading Strategies

| Strategy | Win Rate | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| FVG + IFVG | 76.6% | Fair Value Gap detection across multiple macro sessions |
| OTE Silver Bullet | 62.6% | 10 AM Silver Bullet window, Optimal Trade Entry |
| OTE Refined (Long) | 69.1% | Refined OTE entries for bullish setups |
| OTE Refined (Short) | 69.1% | Refined OTE entries for bearish setups |

### Roadmap

**Phase 1 — Launch (Now)**
- $CIPHER token live on Virtuals Protocol (Base)
- 3 bots active on funded accounts
- Live dashboard tracking all performance
- Bot NFT minting goes live

**Phase 2 — Scale**
- Expand to 10+ simultaneous bots
- First funded account payouts
- CoinGecko + CoinMarketCap listings
- Community governance activation

**Phase 3 — Dominate**

### Why $CIPHER?

Most trading tokens are backed by nothing — just promises and hype. $CIPHER is backed by **real trading revenue**. When bots profit, tokens get bought and burned. The more successful the trading, the more deflationary $CIPHER becomes.

This isn't speculation. It's a machine.

## FAQ Document

**Q: Is this paper trading?**
A: No. We trade on real funded accounts through Apex Trader Funding on Tradovate. Real money, real risk, real results.

**Q: How does the buyback work?**
A: 80% of net trading profits are used to buy $CIPHER tokens on the open market. Those tokens are then burned (sent to a dead address), permanently reducing supply.

**Q: What are the Bot NFTs?**
A: 20 limited-edition NFTs that represent ownership of a trading bot instance. Each is bound to a specific strategy. Holders receive priority rewards and governance rights.

**Q: What blockchain is $CIPHER on?**
A: Base (Coinbase's L2). Fast, cheap, and growing ecosystem.

**Q: How can I verify the trading is real?**
A: Visit our live dashboard at decryptlabs.io/city.html. Every trade is logged with entry, exit, and P&L. On-chain buyback transactions are published with links.

**Q: What happens if the bots lose money?**
A: No buybacks occur during losing periods. We only buy and burn when there are net profits. Our strategies have 62-77% win rates across 14,500+ backtested trades.

**Q: How many bots are running?**
A: Currently 3 active bots. The system supports up to 20 simultaneous bots across 4 strategies.

**Q: Is there a pre-sale or private round?**
A: No. Fair launch through Virtuals Protocol bonding curve. No pre-sale discounts.

## Pre-buy Strategy Recommendation

To prevent snipers and secure supply for the team:

| $VIRTUAL Amount | % Supply | USD Cost (~$0.65/VIRTUAL) |
|-----------------|----------|--------------------------|
| 1,100 | ~15% | ~$715 |
| 2,600 | ~30% | ~$1,690 |
| 4,100 | ~40% | ~$2,665 |
| 6,000 | ~50% | ~$3,900 |

**Recommendation:** 2,600-4,100 $VIRTUAL (30-40% supply) — enough to maintain control and prevent snipers without looking like a rug setup.
