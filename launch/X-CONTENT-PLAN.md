# 7-Day X Content Plan — @PriceCipherHQ
## $CIPHER Launch on Virtuals Protocol

**Tone:** Confident, quiet. We're not screaming — we're building. Let results speak.

---

### Day 1 (Launch Day)
**Post 1 — Launch Announcement**
> $CIPHER is live on @virtikiverse
>
> An AI agent that trades real funded futures accounts. 80% of profits buy back and burn $CIPHER.
>
> No promises. Just a machine.
>
> decryptlabs.io
>
> 🧵👇

**Post 2 — Thread (4-5 tweets)**
1. What is Decrypt Labs? (brief overview)
2. How the bots work (4 ICT strategies, funded accounts)
3. The flywheel (profits → buyback → burn → repeat)
4. Live dashboard screenshot
5. Link to Virtuals + website

### Day 2 — Transparency
> Every trade our bots make is logged. Every profit tracked. Every buyback published.
>
> This is what transparency looks like.
>
> [Dashboard screenshot]
>
> decryptlabs.io/city.html

### Day 3 — Strategy Deep Dive
> Our FVG+IFVG strategy has a 76.6% win rate across 14,500+ backtested trades.
>
> It identifies institutional footprints — Fair Value Gaps where smart money left traces.
>
> No indicators. No guessing. Pure ICT methodology.

---

### Day 4 — The Burn Mechanic
> Most tokens promise utility. $CIPHER delivers math.
>
> 80% of every dollar our bots earn buys $CIPHER off the market and burns it. Forever.
>
> The more we trade, the less supply exists. Deflationary by design.

---

### Day 5 — Bot Fleet
> 3 bots. 4 strategies. Up to 20 simultaneous positions.
>
> While you sleep, Jimmy is trading Nasdaq futures on funded accounts.
>
> No emotion. No hesitation. No days off.
>

### Day 6 — Social Proof / Results
> Week 1 results incoming.
>
> [Post actual P&L if available, or dashboard metrics]
>
> We don't hype. We just trade.

---

### Day 7 — Community
> $CIPHER isn't about noise. It's about compounding.
>
> Every epoch, profits flow. Tokens burn. Supply shrinks.
>
> We're not trying to be the loudest. Just the most consistent.
>
> Join us: discord.gg/FSP8HZad
